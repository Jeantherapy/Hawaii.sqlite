## Report: Statistical Analysis of Weather Differences between June and December

### Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the weather conditions between the months of June and December in order to identify key differences. The analysis focuses on temperature data from a given dataset and provides insights into the variations in weather patterns during these two months.

### Results:
The analysis consists of two deliverables: (1) a summary of temperature statistics for June and (2) a summary of temperature statistics for December.

1. Summary of Temperature Statistics for June:
   - The average temperature in June is approximately 75.0 degrees Fahrenheit.
   - The minimum temperature recorded in June is around 64.0 degrees Fahrenheit.
   - The maximum temperature recorded in June is about 85.0 degrees Fahrenheit.

### Summary:
Based on the analysis of temperature data for June and December, the following key differences in weather can be observed:

1. Average Temperature: In June, the average temperature is slightly higher (around 75.0 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to December (approximately 71.0 degrees Fahrenheit). This indicates that June tends to be warmer on average than December.

2. Temperature Range: The temperature range in June is broader, with a minimum of 64.0 degrees Fahrenheit and a maximum of 85.0 degrees Fahrenheit. In contrast, the temperature range in December is narrower, with a minimum of 56.0 degrees Fahrenheit and a maximum of 83.0 degrees Fahrenheit. This suggests that December experiences less temperature variation compared to June.

3. Seasonal Variation: The analysis highlights that December generally has lower temperatures compared to June. This aligns with the fact that June is a summer month in many regions, while December corresponds to winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

Two Additional Queries for Further Analysis:
To gather more weather data for June and December, the following additional queries can be performed:

1. Precipitation Analysis: Perform a query to retrieve the precipitation data for June and December. This will provide insights into the differences in rainfall patterns between the two months, which can further enhance the understanding of the contrasting weather conditions.

2. Wind Speed Analysis: Conduct a query to extract wind speed data for June and December. Analyzing the wind speed differences between these months can shed light on the variations in atmospheric conditions and potential influences on the overall weather patterns.

By including precipitation and wind speed data in the analysis, a more comprehensive understanding of the weather disparities between June and December can be achieved, enabling further insights and informed decision-making.

Overall, this analysis demonstrates that there are significant differences in weather conditions between June and December, with June being warmer on average and experiencing broader temperature ranges. Further analysis incorporating additional weather parameters would provide a more comprehensive view of the distinctions between these two months.
